# readFileNames
Tiny hack program, packaged using pycache, with the purpose of reading filenames in a directory and generating a text file containing those filenames.

## Description
Created in Python, this program takes two absolute paths as input. The first path will be the location where all filenames should be read. The second path will be the directory where the text file should be generated.

### Notes
Please note that this project was initially created in a short amount of time to solve a problem for a friend. It may be somewhat 'hacky'.
